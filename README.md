# Smart Car Parking System

This project is a Smart Car Parking System that utilizes the Eclipse IDE for development and iFogSim for simulation. The system aims to efficiently manage car parking using fog computing principles.

## Introduction

The Smart Car Parking System is designed to optimize the parking process by providing real-time information about available parking spots. This system leverages fog computing to process data locally, reducing latency and improving the overall efficiency of the parking management system.

## Features

- Real-time parking spot availability
- Fog computing for low-latency data processing
- User-friendly interface

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Eclipse IDE installed on your machine
- iFogSim library integrated with Eclipse
- Java Development Kit
